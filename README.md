# Oligoclonal Band Detection From CSF Images

This software effort uses CSF scans from a hospital to identify Oligoclonal Bands, which are indicative of MS illness. Oligoclonal Bands in CSF imaging can occasionally be hard with the human eye to distinguish clearly. Determining the exact count of oligoclonal bands is crucial for making a diagnosis of the illness. The major goal in this regard is to reduce human mistake potential. We collaborated with the physicians who practices medical biochemistry as part of the project's scope.
